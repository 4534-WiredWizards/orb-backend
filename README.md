# orb-backend
Uses Flask to offer a public-facing API utilizing neural networks for per-team defense and goal ratings, and some algorithms to organize this information into per-match predictions.

> It is my pleasure to share the culmination of our efforts at Neural Network scouting using our ORB system. It was not my intention to share this code in such an unorganized form, but we do not have the resources to thoroughly document this code at the present time. Demand has risen for this code, so we've decided to release it in its current form. Please open PRs and issues on this repository directly, and we'll try and get to them as best we can. This system was designed for _FIRST_ Stronghold, and predictions are to be taken with a grain of salt. Team 4534, the Wired Wizards, hopes to continue to support ORB through future FRC games, and we plan to provide the same standard of service we provided during the world championship all season long. In the mean time, feel free to use this code for offseason events at your own discretion. Pair this with the `orb-client` repo, and you'll really have something. We hope you enjoy ORB!
